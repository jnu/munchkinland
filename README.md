Munchkinland
===

Chrome extension to render ANSI color codes in text content.


# About

Detects plain-text content, parses any [ANSI Color sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)
in the document, and renders them.

Useful for inspecting machine logs such as from CI environments.

The default theme is an approximation of what I currently use in my terminal.
This could be customizable.


## Development

Package with `zip -r munchkinland.zip munchkinland`.


## Why "munchkinland"?

Because Toto, [we're not in Kansas anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6D8PAGelN8).
